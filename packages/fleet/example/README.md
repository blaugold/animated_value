This Flutter project contains a number of small self contained demos to
demonstrate the Fleet framework:

- [counter_app.dart] shows how to use a Fleet view to implement the canonical
  Flutter counter app.
- [interactive_box_fleet.dart] and [interactive_box_flutter.dart] implement the
  same interactive animation, one using the Fleet framework and the other using
  the standard components from the Flutter framework.
- [simple_declarative_animation.dart] shows how to animate in a declarative
  style with `Animated`.
- [simple_imperative_animation.dart] shows how to animate in an imperative style
  with `AnimatingStateMixin.setStateAsync`.
- [stack.dart] shows how to stagger animations through `AnimatedSpec.delay`.
