This Flutter project contains a number of small self contained demos to
demonstrate the Fleet framework:

- [interactive_box_fleet.dart] and [interactive_box_flutter.dart] implement the
  same interactive animation, one using the Fleet framework and the other using
  the standard components from the Flutter framework.
- [simple_declarative_animation.dart] shows how to animate though in a
  declarative style with `Animated`.
- [simple_imperative_animation.dart] shows how to animate though in an
  imperative style with `setStateWithAnimation`.
- [stack.dart] shows how to stagger animations through `AnimatedSpec.delay`.
